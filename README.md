DRAMA: Diabetic Retinopathy Assessment through Multi-task Learning Approach on Heterogeneous Fundus Image Datasets
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness. The clinical applications of artificial intelligence in DR screening are constrained by the lack of generalizability to real-world settings. We developed and validated a diabetic retinopathy assessment model through multi-task learning approach on the heterogeneous fundus image datasets (DRAMA), which undertakes 11 tasks, including pre-diagnostic assessment, lesion detection, and DR grading. Our analysis encompassed a significant corpus of 1861 images from 957 patients. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for assessing image quality, detecting lesions, and grading stood at 0.9622, 0.9702 and 0.9319, respectively. In real-world cohorts, DRAMA's efficacy was evident with ROC areas stretching from 0.8699 to 0.9980, surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of retinal specialists by over 7%. Altogether, this framework introduces a scalable tool for DR diagnosis, promoting broad applicability in fundus image datasets and paving a new avenue for DR management in the foreseeable future.
